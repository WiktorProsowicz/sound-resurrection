# Sound Resurrection

Sound Resurrection is a project containing research results from the Sound Processing in ML area. The goal of the research is to design a model performing sound generation based on masked input with the focus put on the sound taken from video conferences.

The following document contains brief description of the project as well as the explanation of the project's structure. 

## Project structure

```yaml
root:
    src:                    # contains the source code 
        preprocessing:      # contains data preprocessing tools
    test:                   # contains tests for the software
    data:                   # contains used data sets
```

## Literature

During project development we acquire both necessary domain-specific knowledge as well as the overall knowledge about the ML solutions. Below is the list containing collected used resources.
